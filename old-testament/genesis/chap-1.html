    <h1>NKJV Old Testament</h1>
    <h2>Genesis</h2>
    <p><span class="chapter-num">1</span> <span class="verse">1</span> In the beginning God created the heavens and the
      earth.
      <span class="verse">2</span> The earth was without form, and void; and darkness
      was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
    </p>
    <p><span class="verse">3</span> Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. <span
        class="verse">4</span> And God saw the light, that
      it was good; and God
      divided the light from darkness. <span class="verse">5</span> God called the light day, and the darkness He called
      Night. So the
      evening and
      the morning were the first day.</p>
    <p><span class="verse">6</span> Then God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it
      divide the waters
      from the
      waters." <span class="verse">7</span> Thus God made the firmament, and divide the waters which were under the
      firmament from the
      waters which
      were above the firmament; and it was so. <span class="verse">8</span> And God called the firmament Heaven. So the
      evening and the
      morning
      were the second day.
    </p>
    <p><span class="verse">9</span> Then God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one
      place, and let the dry
      land appear"; and it was so. <span class="verse">10</span> And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering
      together of the
      waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</p>

    <p><span class="verse">11</span> Then God said, "let the earth bring forth
      grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in
      itself, on the earth"; and it was so. <span class="verse">12</span> And the earth brought forth grass, the herb
      that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its
      kind. And God saw that it was good. <span class="verse">13</span> So the evening and the morning were the third
      day.</p>
