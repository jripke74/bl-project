    <h1>NKJV Old Testament</h1>
    <h2>Genesis</h2>
    <p><span class="chapter-num">1</span><sup>1</sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
      <sup>2</sup> The earth was without form, and void; and darkness
      was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
    </p>
    <p><sup>3</sup> Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. <sup>4</sup> And God saw the light, that
      it was good; and God
      divided the light from darkness. <sup>5</sup> God called the light day, and the darkness He called Night. So the
      evening and
      the morning were the first day.</p>
    <p><sup>6</sup> Then God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters
      from the
      waters." <sup>7</sup> Thus God made the firmament, and divide the waters which were under the firmament from the
      waters which
      were above the firmament; and it was so. <sup>8</sup> And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the
      morning
      were the second day.
    </p>
    <p><sup>9</sup> Then God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gatered together into one place, and let the dry
      land appear"; and it was so. <sup>10</sup> And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the
      waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. <sup>11</sup> Then God said, "let the earth bring forth
      grass, the herb that yields seed, adn the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in
      itself, on the earth"; and it was so. <sup>12</sup> And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed
      according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw
      that it was good. <sup>13</sup> So the evening and the moring were the third day.</p>
